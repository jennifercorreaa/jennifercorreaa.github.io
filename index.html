              <p>Joaquin Guzman also known as "El Chapo" (which is mexican slang for shorty) is the most known Mexican drug lord and founded the Sinaloa cartel in 1989, and over time building it into an immensely profitable global drug-trafficking operation. While as other people love him or admire him because of the many times he's escaped top-security prisons and just police in general. Others also admire him for his hate towards the president and love for Mexico's culture and drugs.
